## 2  User Description

### Feature Overview

Create a comprehensive set of atomic DevCard templates for common development tasks. These templates provide standardized TaskSpec definitions for routine development activities, ensuring consistency and completeness across projects.

### User Value  

- **Standardization**: Consistent approach to common development tasks
- **Efficiency**: Pre-defined templates speed up task creation
- **Quality**: Built-in best practices and acceptance criteria
- **Reusability**: Templates can be used across different projects and features

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want standardized DevCard templates so that I can quickly create well-defined tasks
2. **As a project manager**, I want consistent task formats so that I can better track and estimate work
3. **As a team lead**, I want quality templates so that junior developers follow best practices
4. **As an agent**, I want atomic task definitions so that I can break down complex requests efficiently

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each DevCard template is atomic and focused on a single responsibility
- [ ] Templates include clear acceptance criteria and testing requirements
- [ ] All templates follow established naming and sizing conventions
- [ ] Templates are reusable across different project contexts

## 3  Planner Breakdown

### Technical Approach

Create individual TaskSpec templates for each common development activity type. Each template follows the established TaskSpec structure with pre-defined acceptance criteria, testing requirements, and size constraints based on task type.

### Architecture Impact

No direct impact on system architecture. These are planning artifacts that support the development process and state management framework.

### Dependencies

- Existing TaskSpec template structure
- Type-based LOC cap definitions
- State management framework conventions

### Risk Assessment  

**Risks:**
- Templates may become outdated if not maintained
- Over-standardization might limit flexibility for unique cases
- Templates might not cover all edge cases

**Mitigation:**
- Regular review and update of templates
- Allow customization of templates for specific contexts
- Maintain a balance between standardization and flexibility

### Testing Strategy

Templates will be validated through:
- Review of generated TaskSpecs against established patterns
- Usage in real development scenarios
- Feedback collection from developers using the templates

### Rollout Plan

1. Create initial set of 8 core DevCard templates
2. Document template usage patterns
3. Gather feedback from initial usage
4. Iterate and expand template library as needed
5. Integrate templates into agent workflows and documentation
