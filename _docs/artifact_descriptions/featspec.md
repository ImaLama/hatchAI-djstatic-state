# FeatSpec Artifact Description

## Overview
A FeatSpec (Feature Specification) is an immutable specification document that defines the requirements, approach, and structure for a feature implementation. It mirrors the hatchAI-devcards FeatCard structure but contains no state information.

## Format
- **File naming**: `NNN-FS-YYYY-MM-DD-DESCRIPTION.yaml`
- **Example**: `001-FS-2025-08-18-USER-AUTH.yaml`
- **Location**: `_specs/featspecs/`

## Structure

### YAML Frontmatter
```yaml
id: 001-FS-2025-08-18-USER-AUTH
title: Implement user authentication system
created: 2025-08-18
sprint: S4
```

### Content Sections
1. **DevCards Table**: Lists associated TaskSpecs (implementation tasks)
2. **User Description**: Feature overview, value, user stories, acceptance criteria
3. **Planner Breakdown**: Technical approach, architecture impact, dependencies, risks, testing, rollout

## Key Characteristics

### Immutable Fields
- `id`: Unique sequential identifier
- `title`: Feature title (≤72 characters)
- `created`: Creation date (always TODAY)
- `sprint`: Sprint assignment

### Content Sections
- User-focused requirements and value proposition
- Technical planning and architectural considerations
- High-level acceptance criteria
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Relationship to Other Artifacts

### Paired FeatState
Each FeatSpec has a corresponding FeatState file:
- **FeatSpec**: `001-FS-2025-08-18-USER-AUTH.yaml` (immutable)
- **FeatState**: `001-FSTATE-2025-08-18-USER-AUTH.yaml` (mutable)

### Child TaskSpecs
FeatSpecs reference their implementation TaskSpecs in the DevCards table:
```yaml
| DevCard ID | Title | Dependencies | Notes |
|------------|-------|--------------|-------|
| 001-TS-2025-08-18-JWT-MIDDLEWARE | Add JWT middleware | - | Core auth component |
| 002-TS-2025-08-18-AUTH-ROUTES | Authentication routes | 001-TS-... | API endpoints |
```

## Example FeatSpec

```yaml
---
id: 001-FS-2025-08-18-USER-AUTH
title: Implement user authentication system
created: 2025-08-18
sprint: S4
---

## 1  DevCards

| DevCard ID | Title | Dependencies | Notes |
|------------|-------|--------------|-------|
| 001-TS-2025-08-18-JWT-MIDDLEWARE | Add JWT middleware | - | Core auth component |
| 002-TS-2025-08-18-AUTH-ROUTES | Authentication routes | 001-TS-... | API endpoints |
| 999-TS-2025-08-18-AUTH-INTEGRATION | Integration tests for auth | 001-TS-..., 002-TS-... | **Required** - End-to-end testing |

## 2  User Description

### Feature Overview
Implement a comprehensive user authentication system supporting JWT tokens, role-based access control, and secure session management.

### User Value
- Secure user account management
- Protected access to application features
- Role-based permissions and access control

### User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want to create an account so that I can access protected features
2. **As a user**, I want to log in securely so that my data is protected
3. **As an admin**, I want to manage user permissions so that I can control access

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register new accounts
- [ ] Users can authenticate with email/password
- [ ] JWT tokens are issued and validated
- [ ] Role-based access control is enforced
- [ ] Sessions can be revoked/expired

## 3  Planner Breakdown

### Technical Approach
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- bcrypt password hashing
- Role-based access control middleware
- Secure session management

### Architecture Impact
- New authentication middleware layer
- Database schema for users and roles
- API endpoints for auth operations
- Frontend login/register components

### Dependencies
- JWT library selection and integration
- Database migration for user schema
- Security review for auth implementation

### Risk Assessment
- **Security risks**: Password storage, token security, session management
- **Performance risks**: Auth middleware on all protected routes
- **Integration risks**: Frontend/backend coordination

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for auth functions
- Integration tests for auth flows
- Security testing for vulnerabilities
- Load testing for auth performance

### Rollout Plan
1. Backend auth implementation
2. Frontend integration
3. Security review and testing
4. Gradual rollout with feature flags
5. Full deployment with monitoring
```

## Creation and Management

### Creation
```bash
# Interactive mode
task featspec-new

# Programmatic mode
DESCRIPTION=USER-AUTH TITLE="Implement user authentication system" task featspec-new
```

### Properties
- **Immutable**: Once created, specifications should not change
- **Sequential numbering**: Automatic three-digit prefix assignment
- **Template-based**: Created from standardized template
- **Paired creation**: Automatically creates corresponding FeatState file

## Best Practices

1. **Clear, actionable titles** (≤72 characters)
2. **Comprehensive user stories** covering all use cases
3. **Detailed acceptance criteria** that can be tested
4. **Realistic risk assessment** with mitigation strategies
5. **Complete TaskSpec planning** in DevCards table
6. **Architecture impact analysis** for system-wide effects
