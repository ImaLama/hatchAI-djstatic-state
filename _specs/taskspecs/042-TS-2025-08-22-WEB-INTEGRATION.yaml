# =============================================================

## 1  Context
Implementing end-to-end integration tests for the agent monitoring web interface (parent: 007-FS-2025-08-22-AGENT-WEB-INTERFACE).
This ensures the complete data flow works correctly from file changes through WebSocket updates to frontend display and TTS notifications.

## 2  Objectives (acceptance criteria)
List **observable, testable** outcomes. Use MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT keywords.

| # | Acceptance Test | Type | File/Command | Execution Evidence Required |
|---|-----------------|------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | MUST test full data flow: file change → WebSocket → UI update | e2e | integration test | Show <1s latency for complete flow |
| 2 | MUST test multiple concurrent WebSocket clients | load | multi-client test | Show 10+ clients receiving same updates |
| 3 | MUST test agent state changes trigger TTS notifications | audio | TTS integration | Show audio announcement on state change |
| 4 | MUST test error recovery after temporary file corruption | recovery | error simulation | Show system recovery from bad JSON |
| 5 | MUST test WebSocket reconnection after network interruption | reconnect | network test | Show automatic reconnection working |
| 6 | MUST test log file parsing with various session formats | parsing | log format test | Show handling of different log structures |
| 7 | MUST test FeatCard/TaskSpec YAML parsing edge cases | yaml | YAML edge cases | Show graceful handling of malformed YAML |
| 8 | MUST test agent_states.json schema validation | schema | invalid JSON test | Show validation catches malformed data |
| 9 | MUST test missing session log file handling | logs | missing file test | Show graceful fallback for nonexistent logs |
| 10 | SHOULD test system performance under continuous updates | performance | stress test | Show stable performance with rapid changes |

## 3  Non-Goals / Anti-Goals
- NOT testing individual unit functions (covered in component TaskSpecs)
- NOT implementing load testing beyond 50 concurrent clients
- NOT testing browser compatibility (handled in frontend TaskSpec)
- NOT implementing automated UI testing with headless browsers
- NOT testing security aspects (out of scope for POC)

## 4  Design Constraints
• Integration tests must complete in < 30 seconds total
• Tests must not modify production agent_states.json file
• Test data must be isolated in _test/ directory
• Tests must clean up temporary files after completion
• Network tests must use localhost only
• Performance tests must not impact other system components

## 5  Implementation Checklist (Factory)
- [ ] Add failing tests for each acceptance criterion
- [ ] Set up test environment with isolated data files
- [ ] Create agent_states.json modification simulation
- [ ] Implement WebSocket client testing framework
- [ ] Add multi-client connection testing
- [ ] Create TTS notification verification
- [ ] Add error injection and recovery testing
- [ ] Implement network interruption simulation
- [ ] Create log file parsing edge case tests
- [ ] Add YAML parsing error handling tests
- [ ] Add performance stress testing
- [ ] Update parent FeatSpec state tracking
- [ ] Commit with trailer `TaskSpec: 042-TS-2025-08-22-WEB-INTEGRATION status=qa`

## 6  QA Checklist
- [ ] Review test coverage & LoC cap
- [ ] Verify all integration tests pass consistently
- [ ] Test cleanup procedures don't leave artifacts
- [ ] Verify tests don't interfere with production system
- [ ] Test error scenarios don't cause test failures
- [ ] Verify performance benchmarks are met
- [ ] Verify integration with parent FeatSpec
- [ ] If pass, commit trailer `TaskSpec: 042-TS-2025-08-22-WEB-INTEGRATION status=done`

## 7  Post-Merge Tasks
Update parent FeatSpec completion status, document deployment procedures, create production readiness checklist.
