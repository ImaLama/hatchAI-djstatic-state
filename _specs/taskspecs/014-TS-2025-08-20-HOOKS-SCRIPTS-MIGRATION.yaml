## 1  Context
Reorganize _hatch_scripts directory for better maintainability. Hook-related scripts (claude_start_hook.sh, claude_stop_hook.sh, hook_circuit_breaker.sh, hook_validator.sh, secure_hook_executor.sh, secure_hook_framework.sh) need to be moved to a dedicated hooks_scripts subfolder to improve organization and discoverability.

## 2  Objectives (acceptance criteria)
List **observable, testable** outcomes. Use MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT keywords.

| # | Acceptance Test | Type | File/Command | Execution Evidence Required |
|---|-----------------|------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | hooks_scripts subfolder MUST exist | filesystem | `ls -d _hatch_scripts/hooks_scripts/` | Directory exists |
| 2 | All hook scripts MUST be moved to hooks_scripts/ | filesystem | `ls _hatch_scripts/hooks_scripts/*.sh` | Shows 6 hook-related scripts |
| 3 | Original hook scripts MUST NOT exist in root | filesystem | `ls _hatch_scripts/claude_*hook*.sh` | No files found |
| 4 | All moved scripts MUST retain execute permissions | filesystem | `ls -l _hatch_scripts/hooks_scripts/*.sh` | All show -rwx permissions |
| 5 | Git history MUST be preserved via git mv | version | `git log --follow _hatch_scripts/hooks_scripts/claude_start_hook.sh` | Shows full history |

## 3  Non-Goals / Anti-Goals
- Will NOT modify script contents
- Will NOT handle updating references (separate TaskSpec)
- Will NOT create symlinks for backward compatibility

## 4  Design Constraints
• Keep functions ≤ 40 LoC.  
• All public funcs accept `context.Context`.  
• No new third-party deps without Planner sign-off.  
• Follow METHOD-03 (Contract-First).
• Must integrate cleanly with parent FeatSpec: {{parent_featspec}}

## 5  Implementation Checklist (Factory)
- [ ] Add failing tests for each acceptance criterion
- [ ] Implement code until tests pass & linting clean
- [ ] Update parent FeatSpec state tracking
- [ ] Commit with trailer `TaskSpec: {{id}} status=qa`

## 6  QA Checklist
- [ ] Review test coverage & LoC cap
- [ ] Compare code vs Architecture-Implementation Alignment Matrix
- [ ] Verify integration with parent FeatSpec
- [ ] If pass, commit trailer `TaskSpec: {{id}} status=done`

## 7  Post-Merge Tasks
Update parent FeatSpec state, close related issues.
