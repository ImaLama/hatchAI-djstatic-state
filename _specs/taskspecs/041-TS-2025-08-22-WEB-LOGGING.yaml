# =============================================================
---

## 1  Context
Implementing comprehensive error handling and debug logging for the agent monitoring web interface (parent: 007-FS-2025-08-22-AGENT-WEB-INTERFACE).
This creates a robust logging framework for debugging WebSocket connections, file monitoring, and frontend issues with structured log output.

## 2  Objectives (acceptance criteria)
List **observable, testable** outcomes. Use MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT keywords.

| # | Acceptance Test | Type | File/Command | Execution Evidence Required |
|---|-----------------|------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | MUST log all WebSocket connection events with timestamps | logging | WebSocket test | Show connect/disconnect/error logs |
| 2 | MUST log file monitoring events and errors | monitoring | file watch test | Show file change detection logs |
| 3 | MUST handle and log JSON parsing errors gracefully | error | malformed JSON test | Show error handled without crash |
| 4 | MUST implement structured logging with log levels | structure | log level test | Show DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR levels |
| 5 | MUST create rotating log files in _logs/web-interface/ | files | log rotation | Show daily log rotation working |
| 6 | MUST log frontend errors via WebSocket to backend | frontend | frontend error | Show client errors logged on server |
| 7 | SHOULD provide debug endpoint for real-time log viewing | endpoint | `/debug/logs` endpoint | Show log streaming via HTTP |
| 8 | SHOULD include request correlation IDs for tracing | tracing | correlation test | Show same ID across related log entries |

## 3  Non-Goals / Anti-Goals
- NOT implementing log aggregation to external systems
- NOT storing logs in database (file-based only)
- NOT implementing log analysis or alerting
- NOT exposing sensitive data in logs
- NOT implementing log compression for POC

## 4  Design Constraints
• Use existing _logs/ directory structure
• Log files must follow naming: web-interface-YYYY-MM-DD.log
• Error handling must not throw uncaught exceptions
• Log rotation must not lose data during transition
• Debug logs must be disabled in production by default
• Correlation IDs must be 8-character alphanumeric

## 5  Implementation Checklist (Factory)
- [ ] Add failing tests for each acceptance criterion
- [ ] Set up structured logging library (winston or similar)
- [ ] Implement log levels (DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR)
- [ ] Create log rotation with daily files
- [ ] Add WebSocket event logging
- [ ] Implement file monitoring error handling
- [ ] Add JSON parsing error recovery
- [ ] Create frontend error reporting via WebSocket
- [ ] Add correlation ID generation and tracking
- [ ] Implement debug endpoint for log streaming
- [ ] Update parent FeatSpec state tracking
- [ ] Commit with trailer `TaskSpec: 041-TS-2025-08-22-WEB-LOGGING status=qa`

## 6  QA Checklist
- [ ] Review test coverage & LoC cap
- [ ] Test log rotation at midnight boundary
- [ ] Verify error handling doesn't crash server
- [ ] Test correlation ID propagation across components
- [ ] Verify debug endpoint security (no sensitive data)
- [ ] Test log file permissions and access
- [ ] Verify integration with parent FeatSpec
- [ ] If pass, commit trailer `TaskSpec: 041-TS-2025-08-22-WEB-LOGGING status=done`

## 7  Post-Merge Tasks
Update parent FeatSpec state, document logging configuration, prepare for integration testing.
