# =============================================================

## 1  Context
Implementing TTS (Text-to-Speech) audio notifications for the agent monitoring web interface (parent: 007-FS-2025-08-22-AGENT-WEB-INTERFACE).
This adds voice announcements for agent state changes, task completions, and system events using Web Speech API with priority-based queuing.

## 2  Objectives (acceptance criteria)
List **observable, testable** outcomes. Use MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT keywords.

| # | Acceptance Test | Type | File/Command | Execution Evidence Required |
|---|-----------------|------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | MUST announce agent state changes via TTS | tts | agent state change | Audio: "Agent Aurora is now busy" |
| 2 | MUST support priority-based message queuing | queue | priority test | Critical messages interrupt normal ones |
| 3 | MUST detect and use best available system voice | voice | voice selection | Show preferred voice selected from available |
| 4 | MUST allow TTS volume and rate configuration | config | settings test | Show volume/rate controls working |
| 5 | MUST handle browser TTS permission gracefully | permission | permission test | Show fallback when TTS not available |
| 6 | MUST provide mute/unmute toggle functionality | control | mute test | Show TTS can be enabled/disabled by user |
| 7 | SHOULD announce task completion events | events | task completion | Audio: "Task completed by Agent Plato" |
| 8 | SHOULD limit queue size to prevent audio spam | limit | queue overflow | Show queue limited to 5 pending messages |

## 3  Non-Goals / Anti-Goals
- NOT implementing server-side TTS (client-side only)
- NOT storing TTS preferences persistently
- NOT implementing custom voice synthesis
- NOT supporting SSML markup for POC
- NOT implementing multi-language support

## 4  Design Constraints
• Use Web Speech API (no external TTS libraries)
• TTS functions must be non-blocking
• Message queue must not exceed 5 items
• Voice selection must fallback gracefully
• Must handle speechSynthesis browser differences
• Settings must be accessible via UI controls

## 5  Implementation Checklist (Factory)
- [ ] Add failing tests for each acceptance criterion
- [ ] Implement Web Speech API wrapper
- [ ] Create priority-based message queue
- [ ] Add voice detection and selection
- [ ] Implement volume/rate/pitch controls
- [ ] Add mute/unmute functionality
- [ ] Create TTS settings panel
- [ ] Add agent event listeners for TTS triggers
- [ ] Implement queue overflow protection
- [ ] Add browser compatibility checks
- [ ] Update parent FeatSpec state tracking
- [ ] Commit with trailer `TaskSpec: 040-TS-2025-08-22-WEB-TTS status=qa`

## 6  QA Checklist
- [ ] Review test coverage & LoC cap
- [ ] Test TTS across different browsers
- [ ] Verify priority queue interruption works
- [ ] Test behavior when TTS not supported
- [ ] Verify no audio spam during rapid state changes
- [ ] Test voice selection fallback scenarios
- [ ] Verify integration with parent FeatSpec
- [ ] If pass, commit trailer `TaskSpec: 040-TS-2025-08-22-WEB-TTS status=done`

## 7  Post-Merge Tasks
Update parent FeatSpec state, document TTS configuration options, prepare for logging integration.
