## 1  Context
Continue _hatch_scripts reorganization. Service scripts (tmux monitoring services, session monitors, status updater) need dedicated services subfolder. These include: start-tmux-monitoring, stop-tmux-monitoring, status-tmux-monitoring, tmux_session_monitor.sh, tmux_session_end_monitor.sh, tmux_session_capture.sh, tmux_status_updater.sh.

## 2  Objectives (acceptance criteria)
List **observable, testable** outcomes. Use MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT keywords.

| # | Acceptance Test | Type | File/Command | Execution Evidence Required |
|---|-----------------|------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | services subfolder MUST exist | filesystem | `ls -d _hatch_scripts/services/` | Directory exists |
| 2 | All service scripts MUST be moved | filesystem | `ls _hatch_scripts/services/*tmux*` | Shows 7 tmux-related scripts |
| 3 | Original scripts MUST NOT exist in root | filesystem | `ls _hatch_scripts/*tmux*` | No files found |
| 4 | Scripts MUST retain execute permissions | filesystem | `ls -l _hatch_scripts/services/*` | All executable |
| 5 | Git history MUST be preserved | version | `git log --follow _hatch_scripts/services/tmux_session_monitor.sh` | Shows history |

## 3  Non-Goals / Anti-Goals
- Will NOT modify script contents
- Will NOT update references (handled by TaskSpec 018)
- Will NOT change script names

## 4  Design Constraints
• Keep functions ≤ 40 LoC.  
• All public funcs accept `context.Context`.  
• No new third-party deps without Planner sign-off.  
• Follow METHOD-03 (Contract-First).
• Must integrate cleanly with parent FeatSpec: {{parent_featspec}}

## 5  Implementation Checklist (Factory)
- [ ] Add failing tests for each acceptance criterion
- [ ] Implement code until tests pass & linting clean
- [ ] Update parent FeatSpec state tracking
- [ ] Commit with trailer `TaskSpec: {{id}} status=qa`

## 6  QA Checklist
- [ ] Review test coverage & LoC cap
- [ ] Compare code vs Architecture-Implementation Alignment Matrix
- [ ] Verify integration with parent FeatSpec
- [ ] If pass, commit trailer `TaskSpec: {{id}} status=done`

## 7  Post-Merge Tasks
Update parent FeatSpec state, close related issues.
