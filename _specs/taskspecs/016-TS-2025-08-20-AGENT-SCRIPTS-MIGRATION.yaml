## 1  Context
Agent-related scripts need dedicated folder for AI agent usage. Scripts include: agent_pubsub_framework.sh, agent_state_manager.sh, get_agent_sessions_statusbar.sh, pubsub_trigger_processor.sh. These scripts provide functionality for AI agents to manage state and communication.

## 2  Objectives (acceptance criteria)
List **observable, testable** outcomes. Use MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT keywords.

| # | Acceptance Test | Type | File/Command | Execution Evidence Required |
|---|-----------------|------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | agent_scripts subfolder MUST exist | filesystem | `ls -d _hatch_scripts/agent_scripts/` | Directory exists |
| 2 | All agent scripts MUST be moved | filesystem | `ls _hatch_scripts/agent_scripts/agent_*.sh` | Shows 4 agent scripts |
| 3 | pubsub_trigger_processor.sh MUST be moved | filesystem | `ls _hatch_scripts/agent_scripts/pubsub_trigger_processor.sh` | File exists |
| 4 | Original scripts MUST NOT exist in root | filesystem | `ls _hatch_scripts/agent_*.sh` | No files found |
| 5 | Execute permissions MUST be retained | filesystem | `ls -l _hatch_scripts/agent_scripts/*.sh` | All show -rwx |
| 6 | Git history MUST be preserved | version | `git log --follow _hatch_scripts/agent_scripts/agent_state_manager.sh` | Shows history |

## 3  Non-Goals / Anti-Goals
- Will NOT modify script functionality
- Will NOT update script references (TaskSpec 018)
- Will NOT rename scripts

## 4  Design Constraints
• Keep functions ≤ 40 LoC.  
• All public funcs accept `context.Context`.  
• No new third-party deps without Planner sign-off.  
• Follow METHOD-03 (Contract-First).
• Must integrate cleanly with parent FeatSpec: {{parent_featspec}}

## 5  Implementation Checklist (Factory)
- [ ] Add failing tests for each acceptance criterion
- [ ] Implement code until tests pass & linting clean
- [ ] Update parent FeatSpec state tracking
- [ ] Commit with trailer `TaskSpec: {{id}} status=qa`

## 6  QA Checklist
- [ ] Review test coverage & LoC cap
- [ ] Compare code vs Architecture-Implementation Alignment Matrix
- [ ] Verify integration with parent FeatSpec
- [ ] If pass, commit trailer `TaskSpec: {{id}} status=done`

## 7  Post-Merge Tasks
Update parent FeatSpec state, close related issues.
