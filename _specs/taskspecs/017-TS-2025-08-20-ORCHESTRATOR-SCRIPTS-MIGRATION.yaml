## 1  Context
Orchestrator scripts coordinate system-level operations. Scripts include: poc_launcher.sh, poc_superlauncher.sh, poc_injector.sh, init-task.sh, init-qa.sh, merge-qa-approval.sh. These handle task initialization, QA processes, and proof-of-concept orchestration.

## 2  Objectives (acceptance criteria)
List **observable, testable** outcomes. Use MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT keywords.

| # | Acceptance Test | Type | File/Command | Execution Evidence Required |
|---|-----------------|------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | orchestrator_scripts subfolder MUST exist | filesystem | `ls -d _hatch_scripts/orchestrator_scripts/` | Directory exists |
| 2 | All POC scripts MUST be moved | filesystem | `ls _hatch_scripts/orchestrator_scripts/poc_*.sh` | Shows 3 POC scripts |
| 3 | Init scripts MUST be moved | filesystem | `ls _hatch_scripts/orchestrator_scripts/init-*.sh` | Shows 2 init scripts |
| 4 | merge-qa-approval.sh MUST be moved | filesystem | `ls _hatch_scripts/orchestrator_scripts/merge-qa-approval.sh` | File exists |
| 5 | Original scripts MUST NOT exist in root | filesystem | `ls _hatch_scripts/poc_*.sh _hatch_scripts/init-*.sh` | No files found |
| 6 | Execute permissions MUST be retained | filesystem | `ls -l _hatch_scripts/orchestrator_scripts/*.sh` | All show -rwx |

## 3  Non-Goals / Anti-Goals
- Will NOT modify script logic
- Will NOT update script references (TaskSpec 018)
- Will NOT merge similar scripts

## 4  Design Constraints
• Keep functions ≤ 40 LoC.  
• All public funcs accept `context.Context`.  
• No new third-party deps without Planner sign-off.  
• Follow METHOD-03 (Contract-First).
• Must integrate cleanly with parent FeatSpec: {{parent_featspec}}

## 5  Implementation Checklist (Factory)
- [ ] Add failing tests for each acceptance criterion
- [ ] Implement code until tests pass & linting clean
- [ ] Update parent FeatSpec state tracking
- [ ] Commit with trailer `TaskSpec: {{id}} status=qa`

## 6  QA Checklist
- [ ] Review test coverage & LoC cap
- [ ] Compare code vs Architecture-Implementation Alignment Matrix
- [ ] Verify integration with parent FeatSpec
- [ ] If pass, commit trailer `TaskSpec: {{id}} status=done`

## 7  Post-Merge Tasks
Update parent FeatSpec state, close related issues.
