# =============================================================
---

## 1  Context
Provides comprehensive integration testing for the enhanced state management system (003-FS-2025-08-19-STATE-VALIDATION-HISTORY). Ensures that state validation and history logging work together seamlessly in real-world scenarios.

## 2  Objectives (acceptance criteria)
List **observable, testable** outcomes. Use MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT keywords.

| # | Acceptance Test | Type | File/Command | Execution Evidence Required |
|---|-----------------|------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | MUST validate state transitions AND log history for each change | e2e | integration_test.sh | Show validation + logging |
| 2 | MUST handle concurrent state changes with validation and logging | stress | concurrent_integration_test.sh | Show no data loss |
| 3 | MUST maintain < 10ms total overhead for validation + logging | perf | perf_integration_test.sh | Show timing results |
| 4 | MUST properly log validation failures with error context | e2e | error_flow_test.sh | Show error logs |
| 5 | MUST work with all interfaces (bash, Node.js, VSCode) | integration | interface_test.sh | Show all interfaces work |
| 6 | MUST handle edge cases (rapid transitions, system restart) | stress | edge_case_test.sh | Show robustness |

## 3  Non-Goals / Anti-Goals
• Will NOT test individual component internals (covered by unit tests)
• Will NOT implement new functionality (testing only)
• Will NOT modify production code (test code only)
• Will NOT test third-party dependencies

## 4  Design Constraints
• Keep test scenarios realistic and representative
• Use existing test infrastructure and patterns
• Cover both happy path and error scenarios
• Must validate all components from parent FeatSpec: 003-FS-2025-08-19-STATE-VALIDATION-HISTORY

## 5  Implementation Checklist (Factory)
- [ ] Add failing tests for each acceptance criterion
- [ ] Implement code until tests pass & linting clean
- [ ] Update parent FeatSpec state tracking
- [ ] Commit with trailer `TaskSpec: {{id}} status=qa`

## 6  QA Checklist
- [ ] Review test coverage & LoC cap
- [ ] Compare code vs Architecture-Implementation Alignment Matrix
- [ ] Verify integration with parent FeatSpec
- [ ] If pass, commit trailer `TaskSpec: {{id}} status=done`

## 7  Post-Merge Tasks
Update parent FeatSpec state, close related issues.
