## 1  DevCards

| DevCard ID | Title | Dependencies | Notes |
|------------|-------|--------------|-------|
| 021-TS-2025-08-20-PROJECT-STRUCTURE-DOCS | Document project structure in agent prompts and filestructure.md | - | Documentation task |
| 022-TS-2025-08-20-MOUNT-DIRS-RENAME | Rename mounted directories to clearer naming convention | - | Refactoring task |

**Note**: This FeatSpec serves as a container for single, standalone TaskSpecs that don't warrant a full feature specification. Each TaskSpec is independent and self-contained.

## 2  User Description

### Feature Overview

This is a placeholder FeatSpec for adhoc single tasks that are important but don't require a full feature treatment. These tasks are typically:
- Documentation updates
- Configuration changes
- Small improvements
- One-off utilities
- Minor refactoring tasks

### User Value  

- **Flexibility**: Allows quick task creation without feature overhead
- **Efficiency**: Reduces bureaucracy for simple tasks
- **Tracking**: Maintains visibility of small but important work
- **Organization**: Keeps adhoc tasks organized and findable

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to quickly create small tasks so that I can track minor improvements
2. **As a team lead**, I want visibility into adhoc work so that I can understand resource allocation
3. **As an agent**, I want a simple way to document small changes so that work is properly tracked

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each TaskSpec is self-contained and independent
- [ ] TaskSpecs complete their specific objectives
- [ ] Documentation is updated where required
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

## 3  Planner Breakdown

### Technical Approach

Each TaskSpec under this FeatSpec follows its own technical approach as defined in the individual TaskSpec. No overarching technical strategy is required.

### Architecture Impact

Minimal to none - adhoc tasks should not significantly impact system architecture. Any task requiring architectural changes should have its own FeatSpec.

### Dependencies

Individual TaskSpecs may have their own dependencies, but there are no FeatSpec-level dependencies.

### Risk Assessment  

**Risks:**
- Scope creep (tasks growing beyond single-task scope)
- Lack of coordination between related tasks

**Mitigation:**
- Enforce single-task scope during planning
- Move related tasks to proper FeatSpec if patterns emerge

### Testing Strategy

Each TaskSpec defines its own testing requirements. Generally minimal testing for documentation and configuration tasks.

### Rollout Plan

Individual TaskSpecs can be deployed independently as they complete. No coordinated rollout required.
