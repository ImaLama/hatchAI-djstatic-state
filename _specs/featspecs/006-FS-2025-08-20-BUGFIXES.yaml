## 1  DevCards

| DevCard ID | Title | Dependencies | Notes |
|------------|-------|--------------|-------|
| *Dynamic* | Bug fixes added as discovered | - | Each bug gets its own TaskSpec |

**Note**: This FeatSpec serves as a container for bug fixes and hotfixes. TaskSpecs are added dynamically as bugs are discovered and prioritized.

## 2  User Description

### Feature Overview

This is a placeholder FeatSpec for bug fixes and hotfixes that need to be tracked and resolved. Bug fixes are typically:
- Critical production issues (hotfixes)
- Regression bugs
- Logic errors
- Performance issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data integrity problems

### User Value  

- **Stability**: Maintains system reliability and performance
- **Trust**: Ensures user confidence in the system
- **Security**: Addresses vulnerabilities promptly
- **Quality**: Improves overall system quality

### User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want bugs fixed quickly so that I can use the system without disruption
2. **As a developer**, I want bug fixes tracked so that I can understand system issues
3. **As a security officer**, I want vulnerabilities patched so that the system remains secure
4. **As a QA engineer**, I want regression tests added so that bugs don't reoccur

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bug is reproducible and understood
- [ ] Fix resolves the issue without side effects
- [ ] Regression tests prevent reoccurrence
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] No new bugs introduced

## 3  Planner Breakdown

### Technical Approach

Each bug fix follows a standard process:
1. **Reproduce**: Confirm the bug exists
2. **Diagnose**: Identify root cause
3. **Fix**: Implement minimal change to resolve
4. **Test**: Verify fix and add regression tests
5. **Deploy**: Release fix (hotfix if critical)

### Architecture Impact

Bug fixes should have minimal architectural impact. If a bug requires architectural changes, consider whether it's actually a feature request.

### Dependencies

Bug fixes may depend on:
- Access to production logs
- Ability to reproduce issues
- Understanding of original requirements
- Test environment availability

### Risk Assessment  

**Risks:**
- Introducing new bugs while fixing
- Incomplete understanding of root cause
- Breaking changes in hotfixes

**Mitigation:**
- Thorough testing before deployment
- Code review for all fixes
- Regression test suite
- Staged deployment for non-critical fixes

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: For the specific fix
- **Regression tests**: Prevent reoccurrence
- **Integration tests**: Verify no side effects
- **Manual testing**: For UI/UX bugs
- **Performance testing**: For performance bugs

### Rollout Plan

**Hotfixes (Critical)**:
1. Immediate fix development
2. Emergency testing
3. Direct production deployment
4. Post-deployment monitoring

**Regular Fixes**:
1. Standard development cycle
2. Full testing suite
3. Staged deployment
4. Normal release schedule
